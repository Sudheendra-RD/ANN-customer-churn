Customer Churn prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Churn Prediction is a common use case in Machine Learning and Deep Learning domain.
It is very important for the bank to know "why" and "when" a customer will leave the bank.
It has been a key area of business development in the banking industry.

The dataset has 14 input parameters, out of which 11 are important and 1 output parameter, i.e. "Exited" or "Not Exited"
An Artificial Neural Network with 2 hidden layers is used to predict the Churn Customers.

ReLu activation function is used, as it most suited for the hidden layers due to it's efficiency in handling Vanishing Gradient and Exploding Gradient problems.

The output layer consists of Sigmoid since it is a Binary Classification problem.
